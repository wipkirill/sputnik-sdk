# Sputnik SDK

This project is aimed to utilize OSM data for fast map rendering, searching and routing on desktop or mobile. Two tools were developed to achieve the goal. The Parser is used to preprocess raw OSM extracts to portable format. The Server tool processes searching, map rendering and routing requests. Please see details and readme in project folders. The source code presented in demo purposes. We can add build instructions by request. See https://github.com/wipkirill/sputnik-sdk-android-demo/wiki for details.
