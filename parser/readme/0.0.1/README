Parser by UrbanLabs version 0.0.1

This file describes UrbanLabs Parser software. The Parser is the simplest way 
to transform OpenStreetMap(c) data into searchable, routable and viewable format. 
You have full control which information is exported to an output SQlite database 
(tile layers, routing, search tags). 

The version 0.0.1 of the given software is a freely distributable developer edition 
which can be used only for for review, demonstration and evaluation purposes.

GETTING STARTED

Untar a downloaded copy of the Parser by running:
     tar -xhzvf parser-<verson>-<platform>.tgz
     cd parser-<verson>

Download some OSM PBF dumps first. They can be found on the websites like GEOFABRIK
(http://www.geofabrik.de/).

The Parser has this basic input syntax:
     ./parser.sh INPUT_FILENAME OUTPUT_FILENAME [OPTIONS]
The options include:
     --pedestrian           pedestrian edge filter (only pedestrian edges to be parsed)
     --highway              highway edge filter (only highway edges to be parsed)
     --search               export information needed for searching osm objects
     --routing              write routing information, without turn restrictions
     --turnrestrictions     this option is only valid with routing enabled. it forces to create edges that obey turn restrictions
     --tiles                dump information needed for rendering map tiles
     --addressdecoder       preprocess addresses of object in order to give approximate addresses and autocompletion when giving partial addresses
     --gtfs                 experimental public transport information/routing
     --debug                increase logging level
     --help                 print this message
     --version              parser version


Example usage:
          ./parser.sh saarbruecken.pbf saar --highway --routing --turnrestrictions --search --tiles --addressdecoder

This command outputs an SQlite database called 'saar' having saarbruecken.pbf as 
an input map file. We have included routing information for cars(--highway) and
considered turning restrictions. By using our Server tool you can also search for 
OSM objects and render tiles. Further info under http://urbanlabs.in and find the 
Server in Products.
