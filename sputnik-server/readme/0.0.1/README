The Server has a dependency from Mapnik 3. On Ubuntu one can easily add a nightly build ppa:

     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install libmapnik

You are ready to go for the Getting started section.

Mac OS X
     We are planning to port the product in next releases.

The Server has this basic input syntax:
     ./server.sh PORT
     The Server will be listening to on the PORT.
Other options include:
     --v                          version
     --debug                      increase logging


Example usage:
          ./server.sh 8080

Put some output files of the Parser tool to the Server directory.
Point your browser to
     http://localhost:8080/index.html?mapname=<MapName>
in order to load the <MapName> file. It should show you a webpage with a map and 
search bar for simple search queries. For more complex examples use the Server documentation.
